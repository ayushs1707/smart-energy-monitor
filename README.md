# Smart Energy Monitoring IoT System

## Overview
A real-time energy monitoring solution built with ACS712 sensors and Python scripts.  
This project measures current consumption, applies calibration for accuracy, and visualizes performance benchmarks.

## Features
- Accurate current measurement using **Raw1 − Raw2 calibration method**
- Python scripts for **data collection, benchmarking, and visualization**
- Architecture diagrams and reproducible workflows
- Clear documentation for academic and professional review

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** ACS712 sensor, microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
- **Languages:** Python
- **Tools:** Matplotlib, CSV data logging, GitHub for version control

## Results
- Benchmarked system performance with **10M and 20M iterations**
- Produced bar charts to visualize efficiency and accuracy
- Delivered structured documentation and reproducible workflows

## Repository Structure
- `/src` → Python scripts
- `/hardware` → Sensor wiring and specs
- `/docs` → Diagrams, reports, presentations
- `/results` → Benchmark outputs and datasets
